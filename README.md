# Cancer-prediction-Youtube

Welcome to our cancer prediction code! This code showcases the power of logistic regression in the context of real-world machine learning applications. Our aim is to demystify the workings of logistic regression and illustrate how machine learning can be applied to solve critical problems, such as cancer diagnosis.

Through this code, we encourage you to explore the practical side of machine learning and inspire you to consider your own applications. Feel free to leave comments or suggestions; we're eager to hear your thoughts on how we can improve this model and make it even more impactful in the real world.

And remember, if you can learn it you can use it.
